During development, various situations may arise, including the need to build controllers into the package operation.


To create a new controller, you must run the command `make:controller`:

```php
php artisan make:controller CustomOrchidController
```

In the `app/Http/Controllers` directory, a new class will be created, change it:

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

class CustomOrchidController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * @return \Illuminate\View\View
     */
    public function index()
    {
        return view('custom');
    }
}

```

The `index` method returns the application template, in which we will visualize the entire package style:

```php
@extends('platform::dashboard')

@section('title','title')
@section('description', 'description')

@section('navbar')
    <div class="text-center">
        Navbar
    </div>
@stop

@section('content')
    <div class="text-center mt-5 mb-5">
        <h1>Content</h1>
    </div>
@stop
```

The created controller must be declared in the route file, for example, in `routes/platform`,
so that common rules apply to it, such as authorization.

```php
Route::get('custom', [\App\Http\Controllers\CustomOrchidController::class, 'index']);
```
